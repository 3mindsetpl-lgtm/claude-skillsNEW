## Copy Editing Checklist

### Clarity Pass
- [ ] Can each sentence be understood on first read?
- [ ] Are there any jargon terms that need simplifying?
- [ ] Is every paragraph making one clear point?
- [ ] Are there sentences trying to do too much?

### Conciseness Pass
- [ ] Remove filler words: "very," "really," "just," "actually," "basically"
- [ ] Remove hedging: "sort of," "kind of," "a little bit"
- [ ] Shorten sentences where possible (target 15-20 words average)
- [ ] Delete entire sentences that don't add value

### Voice Pass
- [ ] Is it active voice? (not "Reports are generated" → "Generate reports")
- [ ] Is the tone consistent throughout?
- [ ] Does it sound like a human talking to another human?
- [ ] Remove corporate-speak: "leverage," "synergize," "facilitate"

### Impact Pass
- [ ] Does the opening hook grab attention?
- [ ] Are benefits concrete and specific?
- [ ] Is every CTA action-oriented?
- [ ] Does the ending drive toward the desired action?
